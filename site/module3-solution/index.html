            <p >
              Our chicken is made from 100% real chicken, not cats. We don't use cats in our meat grinders despite what some people might have said. They're lying, and they cannot be trusted as they no longer work in our meat processing plant. 
            </p>

            <p>
              First off, cat meat is very hard to process. Skinning the cat is a very tedious process. Cats are agile, they scratch, run away, and bite. Each cat has to be skinned differently. 
            </p>

            <p>
              There is no one way to skin a cat. One has to look at the alignment of the breed, skin color, and wrinkles to determine the right method of skinning. It takes years of training. All of these factors contribute into a much longer process than preparing a chicken.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our chicken comes in many many flavors and varieties. We have chicken katsu, chicken kitten, chicken paws, and chicken whisker soup. My personal favorite is chicken meows, which comes with a complimentary chicken mweow-tini.

            <p>
              Our beef is 100% pure beef, not cats. Grazing the cattle from catmandu island, our beef is very tender and tase like real beef. You will be very fur-tunate to try our beef. You might see some fur in our beef, but that is normal because the cattle from catmandu island are a little different... but they have an exhilirating irresistable tase to it. The cattle from catmandu have a long poofy colored fur. Males reach lengths of 28 in and females are usually about 20 in. Weights generally vary from 6 to 10 lb, but some can weigh up to 28 lb.
